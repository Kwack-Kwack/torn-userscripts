# IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ BEFORE USING

The testing script here fetches javascript code from the defined url and evaluates it in the browser on _all_ torn pages. This is an incredibly inefficient way of using userscripts, and only exists as an easy way to test scripts whilst they are being built. Do __NOT__ install userscripts for regular use this way. 

Please also note that this userscript evaluates the javascript linked, there are no tests done to protect against malicious code. __Evaluating code is dangerous. Use this script at your own risk.__
