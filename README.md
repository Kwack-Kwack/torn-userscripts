# torn-userscripts
These are a collection of userscripts that I decided to build in my free time, feel free to use or modify as needed.

If you are using extracts of code in your own projects, please give credit (if the code is actually mine). Just a simple comment in the code is more than enough.

Otherwise, the code is free to use and modify as you so please. If anything breaks and needs fixing, or you just wanna talk to me about some of the code, feel free to flick me an in-game message at [Kwack \[2190604\]](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2190604) or on discord (duckyblair#0001). I prefer mail, as I don't log in that often and chats often disappear, but if you see me online or like living on the edge feel free to chat away.

If you use anything for anything special, flick me a message! I won't care about it, but I am curious to see if/how my code is being used. 


## Why is everything so messy?
I'm a messy person, I know. Files in the root folder have been built (and tested) with TornPDA, however updates may break them. If so, feel free to open pull requests or contact me either in-game or on discord `(@duckyblair#0001)`.

The `GM-userscripts` folder contains userscripts built for and tested in Tampermonkey, these should also work in Greasemonkey. They use GM_ functions which will not work in vanilla chrome or PDA.

The `other` folder contains various other files depending on what I am currently working on - including the new PDA testing script. If these files are relevant to anyone else they'll usually have their own README, please read that for extra information.
