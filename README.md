# torn-userscripts
These are a collection of userscripts that I decided to build in my free time, feel free to use or modify as needed.

If you are using extracts of code in your own projects, please give credit (if the code is actually mine). Just a simple comment is more than enough.

Otherwise, the code is free to use and modify as you so please. If anything breaks and needs fixing, or you just wanna talk to me about some of the code, feel free to flick me an in-game message at [Kwack_Kwack\[2190604\]](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2190604). I prefer mail, as I don't log in that often and chats often disappear, but if you see me online or like living on the edge feel free to chat away.

If you use anything for anything special, flick me a message! I won't care about it, but I am curious to see if/how my code is being used.
